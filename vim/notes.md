# Vim

- Stands for Vi Improved

## Plugins

## Vimrc

- Usually located in $HOME/.vimrc
- if all else fails, use echo $HOME and figure out what the crap you did to it
- the vimrc file is synced with the commit script and pushed to github. That way, you can't screw up like the idiot you are


## Package Manager

- You need this in order to install plugins. You know, things like autocomplete or things that'll turn vim into a decent webdev IDE.

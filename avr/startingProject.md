# Mac

For mac, you need to install the avr-crosspack

after installing, you can use the following command to create a new project

avr-project [Name of Project]

However, you still need to update the make file with your ISP config and your microcontroller

Chances are there are only two things you really need to edit in the Make files

- The ISP
- The microcontroller you're using

# Nodejs Notes

## About

Nodejs uses chrome's Javascript V8 engine, so it is a prety big deal

## JSON

 * Stands for Javascript Object Notation
 * This is a format used to translate data. XML is another alternative. 
 * Contains keys and values and values can be any type like an int, boolean or even another object
 * Objects are denotated with Strings
 * WHen you're trying to read json from another website, it will become difficult to read
    * In that case, you can download a google chrome extension that will convert it to human readable format

 * Another good tool is Postman (google chrome extension). This allows you to make test requests from the browser and not in code

## Basics of Node

* The basic of node isn't really that useful. Its main power comes from the npm packages
* There are much more packages than you can imagine
* That being said, you will have to install npm...assuming it doesn't come with node

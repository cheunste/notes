# Website Ideas

This is a collection of project ideas you have. They are organized by either work or personal

*  ['Work']()
* ['Persona']()

### Work

* A weather api app for work purposes. I fucking hate constantly going to weather.gov and several other sites to get data. I need something all in one
* Make a copy of the co worker's clusterfuck of a website

### Personal

* Some sort of central automation server for 'stuff'. 
* I've always wanted to do something Pokemon related...but what exactly?
